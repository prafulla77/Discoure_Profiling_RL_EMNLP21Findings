H Clinton Offers Steps to Ease Hurricane Aid

S1 After touring empty homes that still bear the scars of Hurricane Katrina, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that bureaucratic red tape was ''strangling people'' trying to rebuild here, and proposed steps to speed money to current and former residents of the city.

S2 Most of Mrs. Clinton's ideas involved waiving or streamlining federal rules for distributing relief money, chiefly through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that require multistep paperwork, matching dollars or specific purchases.
S3 The senator, a New York Democrat seeking her party's presidential nomination in 2008, has also proposed legislation to make FEMA an independent, cabinet-level agency.

S4 Some of Mrs. Clinton's ideas, like eliminating a rule that states and cities provide a match to federal emergency dollars, were the sort that community leaders have pushed for some time, and she drew applause from residents who met with her to express frustration about the pace of recovery here.

S5 ''I am embarrassed by our failures as a nation; this administration has really let our country down,'' she said.
S6 ''Let's cut this red tape.
S7 It's strangling people.''

S8 Mrs. Clinton also took a glancing shot at Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, a Republican who she said was not working hard enough with Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, on hurricane issues.
S9 ''She has been waging a lonely battle,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
S10 ''She hasn't had much support from her counterpart; let me just lay it on the table here.''

S11 Calls to Mr. Vitter's offices were not returned last night.

S12 At one point, Mrs. Clinton visibly bristled after walking through the home of Gerard Washington, in the Broadmoor district, and hearing him tell of being ripped off by contractors and strung along by government relief programs.
S13 Broadmoor is one of the areas that benefited from the fund-raising efforts led by former President Bill Clinton and the first President Bush.

S14 ''I'm counting on you as president to come through for us,'' Mr. Washington told Mrs. Clinton outside his half-rehabilitated home.

S15 She replied: ''I'll help you as president; count on it.
S16 I'm not going to stand for stuff like this.
S17 It makes me furious.''

S18 They shook hands, and Mrs. Clinton departed, saying, ''God bless you.''

S19 Mr. Washington was one of several African-American city residents who said they planned to vote for Mrs. Clinton for president.
S20 The most common reasons given were her well-publicized support for hurricane recovery efforts, and her political partnership with Mr. Clinton; several voters said they were excited by the idea of his returning to the White House.
