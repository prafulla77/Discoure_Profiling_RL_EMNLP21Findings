H Uganda arrests former police chief over murder of official - Xinhua

S1 KAMPALA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan military has arrested the country's former police chief and four senior officers over alleged murder of a police spokesperson last year, local media reported Thursday.

S2 Kale Kayihura, former Inspector General of Police (IGP), and close associates were arrested for alleged involvement in the assassination of former Assistant Inspector General of Police, Andrew Felix Kaweesi, who doubled as director of human resource development and police spokesperson in March 2017, according to the state-owned daily New Vision.

S3 Kayihura's arrested associates include Jonathan Baroza, his former personal assistant; Herbert Muhangi, the former commander of police flying squad; Ndahura Amooti, former head of crime intelligence and Richard Ndabwoine, former cyber intelligence chief.

S4 "Security sources revealed that the arrest of Kayihura and his colleagues is in connection with the assassination of former police spokesperson.
S5 All the suspects are expected to be charged before the military court martial," said the paper.

S6 Kaweesi was shot dead by unknown gunmen, together with his bodyguard and driver in Kulambiro, a suburb of the capital Kampala, while heading to work on March 17, 2017.

S7 Kayihura who is still a serving army officer of the Uganda People's Defense Forces has been staying at his Kashagama farm after handing over IGP office to his former deputy on March 15.

S8 Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni sacked Kayihura and Henry Tumukunde as police chief and security minister respectively in a surprise reshuffle in March.

S9 The sacking came after media reports of poor working relationship over a power struggle that led to an increase in murders and insecurity in the East African country.

S10 Since his dismissal, some of Kayihura's close aides have been arrested over allegations of collusion to kidnap the former bodyguard of Rwanda's President Paul Kagame in Kampala and forceful deportation of refugees.
