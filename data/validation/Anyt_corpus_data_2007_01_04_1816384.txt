H 26-year Sentence in Reporterâ€™s Death

S1 One of two men convicted in the killing of a retired reporter for The New York Times was sentenced to 26 years in prison.
S2 The defendant, Michael C. Hamlin, had faced a term of up to 60 years after pleading guilty late last year to second-degree murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery for his part in the attack on the reporter, David E. Rosenbaum, near Mr. Rosenbaum's Washington home a year ago.
S3 At the trial of his cousin Percey Jordan Jr., Mr. Hamlin, 24, testified that he had stolen Mr. Rosenbaum's wallet but that it was Mr. Jordan, wielding a pipe, who had delivered a fatal blow to the victim's head.
S4 Mr. Rosenbaum, 63, died two days later.
S5 Mr. Jordan is to be sentenced before the same judge, Erik P. Christian of District of Columbia Superior Court, later this month.
S6 Convicted of first-degree murder, he faces at least 30 years in prison and a maximum of life without the possibility of parole.
