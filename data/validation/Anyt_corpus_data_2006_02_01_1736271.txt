H Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm

S1 Government complacency, poor planning and dereliction of duty during Hurricane Katrina contributed to the deaths of dozens of the frail and sick in New Orleans, and to the suffering of many others who were stranded in area hospitals and nursing homes unable to care for them, Senate investigators said Tuesday.

S2 In the second day of Senate hearings on the hurricane response, the focus was on what investigators called perhaps the most outrageous chapter of the storm: the mistreatment of nursing home and hospital patients during the disaster.

S3 ''How could such a thing happen?''
S4 Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, asked the officials from the State of Louisiana, the City of New Orleans and the state association of nursing homes who attended the hearings.
S5 ''Why were so many left behind?''

S6 The witnesses acknowledged a long list of failures that meant there was no coordinated or tested plan in place to evacuate the frail, sick or poor, though studies had warned for more than a decade that an estimated 100,000 New Orleans residents without transportation would need such help in a major hurricane.

S7 As a result, patients sat in hospitals and nursing homes for days without electricity, fuel, air-conditioning or sufficient food, the witnesses and senators said.

S8 ''It is natural for all of us to believe that fault lies with someone else,'' said Johnny B. Bradberry, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development.
S9 ''The real truth is Katrina moved faster than we did.
S10 All of us on the local, state and the federal levels were overwhelmed, undermined and outmuscled by Mother Nature.''

S11 Mr. Bradberry, in an interview with Senate staff members before the hearing, acknowledged that he had done nothing to honor an agreement he signed in April 2005 that his department would be responsible for planning the evacuation of the frail in an emergency.

S12 ''We had no plans in place to do any of this,'' he said.

S13 Instead, he testified Tuesday, his focus was on improving the plan for the mass evacuation of the general population, creating a system that opened all the major highway lanes moving away from New Orleans.
S14 This ''contraflow'' plan is credited with helping perhaps 1.2 million area residents get out of harm's way.

S15 Dr. Kevin U. Stephens, director of the New Orleans Health Department, testified that starting in late 2004 he had tried to create his own plan with bus companies, riverboat owners and Amtrak to evacuate the city's ''special needs'' population.
S16 But the negotiations were not complete when Hurricane Katrina hit, Dr. Stephens said, in part because of liability questions.

S17 Nursing homes, meanwhile, were each supposed to have evacuation plans.
S18 At hospitals, because some patients would inevitably be deemed too ill to move, backup generators were to be in place so care could be provided during and after the storm.
S19 But both plans failed, the investigators were told, in a breakdown that had been predicted in regional hurricane emergency drills.

S20 First, only 21 percent of area nursing homes, or nearly 60, evacuated before the storm; one witness said this occurred because in the past, nursing homes were not reimbursed for the cost of the evacuation if the predicted storm did not hit.
S21 And many hospitals ignored years of warnings to put generators and electrical switching equipment in places protected from flooding, the witnesses said.

S22 Once the storm had passed and the city had flooded, even though thousands of patients needed to be evacuated, nursing home operators often could not call for help.
S23 Even when the requests got through, they were not given a high priority, testified Joseph A. Donchess, executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association.

S24 Extraordinary suffering and even death resulted, Mr. Donchess said.
S25 At Bethany Nursing Home in New Orleans, for example, which was surrounded by floodwaters, six or seven patients died while they waited four days for buses to move them, he said.
S26 Louisiana statistics released this week show that nearly 70 percent of the 796 deceased Hurricane Katrina victims identified as of late January were 61 years old or older.

S27 Senator Collins read an e-mail exchange that took place two days before the hurricane hit, in which an official of the federal Department of Health and Human Services asked a Louisiana official if help was needed ''for patient movement/evacuation or anything else.''
S28 The response, an e-mail message from the federal official said, was that ''they do not require anything at this time and they would be in touch if and when they needed assistance.''

S29 Dr. Jimmy Guidry, the state health officer of Louisiana, said the offer for aid was rejected because he did not believe that the federal government was prepared to help.
S30 Ms. Collins said this answer was unacceptable.

S31 ''I wonder,'' she said, ''if the dire straits that we heard described this morning would have been as bad as they were if this offer had been accepted.''
