S4 Shares of roofing and insulation products companies including Beacon Roofing Supply Inc (BECN.O) and Owens Corning (OC.N) rose, while insurers such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N) tumbled.

S5 Florence, the first major hurricane to threaten the eastern United States this year, was forecast to hit the coast of North Carolina or South Carolina on Thursday.
S6 North Carolina ordered residents to evacuate the state’s Outer Banks barrier islands, and the governors of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina declared states of emergency.

S7 The Atlantic hurricane season, which typically runs from June to November, caused more than $250 billion worth of damage in the United States in 2017.

S8 But several industries benefited.
S9 Car rental and hotel companies saw an influx of customers, while freight companies commanded higher prices as capacity tightened due to increased demand for supplies in areas struck by hurricanes.

S10 Here is a summary of how shares are performing as Hurricane Florence approaches:

S11 BUILDING SUPPLIES

S12 Hurricane Florence had a mixed effect on building products companies.
S13 Shares of roofing and insulation companies climbed, while those of cement companies fell.

S14 On Monday, shares of Beacon Roofing rose 8.2 percent, their biggest one-day percentage jump in more than a year.
S15 Owens Corning shares rose 3.7 percent and were the top gainers on the PHLX Housing Index .HGX.

S16 Shares of generator maker Generac Holdings Inc (GNRC.N) also touched a four-year high and were last up 5.6 percent.

S17 But Summit Materials Inc (SUM.N) shares fell 8.1 percent after the cement and concrete supplier warned of adverse weather, including Hurricane Florence, hurting performance in several of its markets.
S18 The shares of peer companies Martin Marietta Materials Inc (MLM.N), Vulcan Materials Co (VMC.N) and Eagle Materials Inc (EXP.N) also declined between 2 percent and 3.5 percent.

S19 HOME IMPROVEMENT

S20 Shares of Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N) and Home Depot hit record highs on Monday.
S21 Lowe’s shares were last trading 2.2 percent higher, while Home Depot shares were up 2.6 percent.

S22 During the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Home Depot shares rose 16.3 percent.
S23 But Lowe’s shares only rose 4.7 percent during that period, lagging the S&P 500, as the chain struggled to compete with Home Depot.

S24 INSURANCE

S25 Allstate shares fell 1.9 percent on Monday.
S26 The insurer had a 10.5 percent market share in South Carolina and a 6.6 percent market share in North Carolina, according to Sandler O’Neill.

S27 Shares of Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N), Progressive Corp (PGR.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N) declined between 1 percent and 2 percent.

S28 CAR RENTAL

S29 Shares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc (HTZ.N) and Avis Budget Group Inc (CAR.O) surged during much of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season on investors’ anticipation of increased demand.
S30 Hertz shares climbed 156.2 percent between June and early November, while Avis shares rose 80.1 percent.

S31 On Monday, Hertz shares rose 4.4 percent and Avis shares added 2.7 percent.

S32 FREIGHT

S33 In 2017 between June 1 and Dec. 1, shares of USA Truck Inc (USAK.O) soared 172.9 percent, while shares of XPO Logistics Inc (XPO.N) and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL.O) climbed more than 40 percent.
S34 J B Hunt Transport Services (JBHT.O) shares rose 26.7 percent over the same period.

S35 On Monday, XPO Logistics shares rose 5.4 percent.
S36 USA Truck shares advanced 3.8 percent, J B Hunt gained 3.7 percent and Old Dominion added 1.6 percent.

S37 HOTELS

S38 Shares of hotel operators were little changed on Monday.
S39 They had gained during the 2017 hurricane season as demand from guests displaced by hurricanes outweighed the hit from storm damage.

S40 From June 1 to Dec. 1, 2017, shares of Hyatt Hotels Corp (H.N) jumped 25.8 percent.
S41 Shares of Marriott International Inc (MAR.O), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) and Choice Hotels International Inc (CHH.N) rose up to 18.9 percent.
