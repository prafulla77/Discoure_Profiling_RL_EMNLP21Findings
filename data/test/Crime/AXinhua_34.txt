H Egypt police kill 4 terrorists involved in car bomb attack - Xinhua

S1 CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian police killed four terrorists of the so-called Hasm group in a shootout during a raid on their hiding place in Upper Egypt's province of Assiut, the Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement Thursday.

S2 The police said the four were involved in a car bomb attack on March 24 in the northern province of Alexandria that killed two policemen and wounded at least four others.

S3 A day after the blast, which failed to harm Alexandria security chief, the police announced killing six of Hasm group militants and said they were involved in the terror operation.

S4 The security forces also arrested two Hasm members during relevant raids, according to Thursday's statement.

S5 The police refers to Hasm group as the armed wing of the currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi.

S6 Hasm appeared in late 2016 and claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks that killed policemen in the country.

S7 Terror activities in Egypt have killed hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians since the military toppled Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his Brotherhood group.

S8 The Sinai-based branch of the Islamic State (IS) regional terrorist group claimed responsibility for most of the terror operations in Egypt over the past few years.

S9 Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief then, following Morsi's ouster.
