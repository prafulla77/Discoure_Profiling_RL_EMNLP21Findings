H For Shareholders, a Ticket Into an $8 Billion Deal

S1 Private equity has done much bigger deals in the last two years.
S2 But the $8 billion buyout for Harman International Industries, the maker of JBL speakers and Harman Kardon home theater systems, may prove the most groundbreaking.

S3 The buyers, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs, have offered Harman shareholders a chance to retain a stake in the newly private company and share in any profit made if the company is later sold or taken public.

S4 Under the terms of the deal, the public shareholders could hold as much as 27 percent of the private company.

S5 The offer represents a major concession to public shareholders, who have increasingly voiced concern about selling their shares to private equity firms only to watch the new owners reap large profits by flipping the companies a few years later, and in some cases a few months.

S6 The Harman deal tries to assuage stockholders by using a provision known as a stub, as in a ticket stub, apparently its first use in the United States amid the latest buyout boom.

S7 Douglas A. Cifu, a partner at the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, said that companies and shareholders might press harder for stub provisions in future buyouts and that private equity might be more willing to offer them.

S8 ''It helps mute some of the criticism that private equity firms are taking all the upside for themselves and are quick-flip artists,'' Mr. Cifu said.

S9 Frederick E. Rowe Jr., a money manager in Dallas who derides many private equity buyouts as ''open sores,'' said last night that the use of a stub in the Harman deal was a step in the right direction.
S10 Should stubs become more prevalent, Mr. Rowe said, shareholders may no longer lose out on their investments.

S11 ''Rather than just arbitrarily squeeze shareholders out, shareholders can now participate,'' he said.
S12 ''I don't see any downsides as all.''

S13 But stubs are not a panacea for shareholders.

S14 Private equity deals often take several years to realize a profit, and investors must be willing to have their holdings locked up in the interim.
S15 Moreover, not all deals make a profit, leaving buyout firms and stub holders with a loss.
S16 At the same time, the public shareholders would be at the whim of the private equity holders with little or no say in the business.

S17 The use of a stub in the Harman deal comes after a similar provision was suggested, but ultimately not used, in the sale of Clear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio company.

S18 After two investors in Clear Channel -- Fidelity Investments and Highfields Capital Management, a hedge fund -- balked at the price, the two suitors, Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners, sent a letter to the Clear Channel board proposing alternatives to raise their offer.

S19 Among them was a stub for existing shareholders.
S20 But the bidders eventually chose to raise their offer to $27.6 billion, from $26 billion.

S21 And stubs sometimes have failed to entice shareholders into selling their companies.

S22 This month, a private equity group in Britain seeking to buy J Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, sweetened its bid by offering up to 25 percent of the company to its shareholders.
S23 In the end, the retailer's founding family, which holds 18 percent of the company's shares, rejected the offer.

S24 Beyond the stub, owners of Harman stock would receive $120 a share, a 17 percent premium over the closing price on Wednesday.
S25 Shares of Harman rose $19.94, or 19.44 percent, to $122.50, suggesting that investors may be anticipating a higher rival offer.
S26 Harman can solicit competing bids for 50 days.

S27 For Sidney Harman, the 88-year-old founder of the company, who owns about 5 percent of its stock, the sale will not end his involvement in the business, which he started in 1953.
S28 As part of the deal, which is expected to close this summer, he will remain as executive chairman.

S29 Mr. Harman has sold the company before, once for $100 million in 1977 after he joined the Carter administration as an assistant commerce secretary.
S30 (His wife, Jane Harman, is a United States representative from California.)
S31 The company performed poorly under the owner at the time, the Beatrice Company, and Mr. Harman bought it back in 1980 for $55 million.

S32 The environment for private equity has grown toxic in other ways as well.

S33 Unions in the United States and Europe, critical of the cuts in jobs or worker benefits that often accompany buyouts, have called for increased government scrutiny of the deals.

S34 This week, a report released by the Service Employees International Union, which represents nearly two million workers, suggested that lawmakers examine certain tax breaks that buyout firms enjoy.
