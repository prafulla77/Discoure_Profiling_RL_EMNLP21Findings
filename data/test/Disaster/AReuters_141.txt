H Indonesian quake survivors scavenging in 'zombie town'; president ramps up aid

S1 PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Hungry survivors of an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia said on Wednesday they were scavenging for food in farms as President Joko Widodo made a second visit to the area to ramp up aid efforts five days after disaster struck.

S2 The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that hit the west coast of Sulawesi island last Friday rose to 1,407, many killed by tsunami waves it triggered.

S4 But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas remain unknown, as communications are down, and bridges and roads have been destroyed or blocked by landslides.

S5 National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said most of the aid effort had been concentrated in Palu, where electricity supply has yet to be restored.

S6 But rescue workers have begun to reach more remote areas in a disaster zone that encompasses 1.4 million people.

S7 Johnny Lim, a restaurant owner reached by telephone in Donggala town, said he was surviving on coconuts.

S8 “It’s a zombie town.
S9 Everything’s destroyed.
S10 Nothing’s left,” Lim said over a crackling line.

S11 “We’re on our last legs.
S12 There’s no food, no water.”

S14 In another part of Donggala district, which has a population of 300,000 people, Ahmad Derajat, said survivors were scavenging for food in fields and orchards.

S15 “What we’re relying on right now is food from farms and sharing whatever we find like sweet potatoes or bananas,” said Derajat whose house was swept away by the tsunami leaving a jumble of furniture, collapsed tin roofs and wooden beams.

S16 “Why aren’t they dropping aid by helicopter?” he asked.

S17 Aid worker Lian Gogali described a perilous situation in Donggala, which includes a string of cut-off, small towns along a coast road north of Palu close to the quake’s epicenter.

S18 “Everyone is desperate for food and water.
S19 There’s no food, water, or gasoline.
S20 The government is missing,” Gogali said, adding that her aid group had only been able to send in a trickle of rations by motorbike.

S21 Underlining a growing sense of urgency, President Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed hotel in Palu.

S22 “What I’ve observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it’s not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters.

S23 ‘PRESIDENT NOT HEARING’

S24 Widodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found.
S25 He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an “evacuation” effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins.

S28 Yahdi Basma, a leader from a village south of Palu hoping to get his family on a cargo plane out, said Widodo had no idea of the extent of the suffering.

S29 “The president is not hearing about the remote areas, only about the tsunami and about Palu,” he said.

S30 “There are hundreds of people still buried under the mud in my village ...
S31 There is no aid whatsoever which is why we’re leaving.”

S32 At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: “Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”.

S33 The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards.

S34 About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said.

S35 Indonesian Red Cross disaster responders said the village of Petobo, just south of Palu, which was home to almost 500 people, had been “wiped off the map”.

S36 “They are finding devastation and tragedy everywhere,” Iris van Deinse, of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement.

S37 Nearby, rescue workers, some using an excavator, were searching for 52 children missing since liquefaction destroyed their bible study camp.
S38 Bodies of 35 of the children have been found.

S39 Aircraft, tents, water treatment facilities and generators were the main needs for survivors including more than 70,000 displaced people, according to the national disaster mitigation agency spokesman.

S41 Sitting on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to quakes and tsunamis.
S42 A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

S43 Adding to Sulawesi’s woes, the Soputan volcano in the north of the island, 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Palu, erupted on Wednesday but there were no reports of casualties or damage.
