S4 Other hard-hit regions where fatalities have been reported include Okayama, Ehime, Kyoto, Yamaguchi, Fukuoka, Kagoshima, Hyogo, Shiga, Gifu, Kochi and Saga prefectures.

S5 The rescue operations have seen local municipalities enlist the help of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) as the ferocity of the storm and the torrential rain has caused the most amount of deaths seen here in recent decades.

S9 Temperature of up to 55.9 degrees Celsius was recorded in one city in Oita Prefecture, and Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) has warned those staying in or providing emergency relief in evacuation shelters to be wary of heatstroke.

S10 Due to the scale of the national disaster, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is to cancel a trip to four countries, so he can deal with the relevant ministries involved with the disaster, local media reported on Monday afternoon.

S11 Abe had planned to visit Belgium, France, Saudi Arabia and Egypt from Wednesday.

S12 Earlier, Abe had told a meeting of a disaster response unit set up to deal with the flooding that the number of rescue personnel including SDF personal sent to the scene had increased to 73,000.

S13 Abe said they are "making utmost efforts to save lives."

S14 As of Monday morning, the health ministry said the water supply to more than 13,600 households remained cutoff and 267,000 households were still without electricity.

S16 More than 200 floods had also been recorded along state-managed rivers, the ministry also said.

S17 The transport ministry said that 13 railroad operators were suspending services on 37 routes in western Japan and other places as of Monday morning.
