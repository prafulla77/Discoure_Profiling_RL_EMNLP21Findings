S3 HAVANA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Four people have died in Cuba over the last two days due to heavy rains associated with subtropical storm Alberto, which led to massive floods in the island nation's central provinces as well as damage to roads, bridges, houses and state institutions.

S4 According to a Cuban state television report, the four victims died due to their imprudence such as walking in flooded areas and swimming in rivers with strong currents.

S5 "We have four people dead so far, two in the province of Ciego de Avila, one in Sancti Spiritus and another in Villa Clara due to reckless behavior," said Interior Minister Julio Gandarilla in a meeting on Tuesday, chaired by the country's president Miguel Diaz-Canel.

S6 Over the last four days, heavy rains have affected the island nation's central provinces, as flood left thousands of homes under water.
S7 Over 51,000 Cubans have been evacuated in the area.

S8 Some 1,384 homes have been affected, with 174 totally collapsed, according to the meeting.
S9 Over 43,000 people remain without electricity in several provinces.

S10 An oil spill was caused by heavy floods at one of the nation's main oil refineries in Cienfuegos.
S11 It has been controlled by local authorities.

S12 Damage has been substantial in the agricultural sector, with crops such as rice, beans, tobacco and bananas particularly affected.

S13 "We must work together and come out of this stronger," said the president.
S14 "Our experience tells us that with climate change these situations are going to occur frequently, therefore we must be prepared and be able to respond to each one of them."

S15 Alberto, which passed through the Gulf of Mexico and hit the U.S. state of Florida and beyond, claimed the lives of two journalists on duty in the U.S. state of North Carolina on Monday, local media reported.

S16 Last year, Cuba was severely affected by hurricane Irma, which left 10 dead, and caused an estimated damage of 13 billion U.S. dollars.
