H Gulf Region Gains Help in New Law on War Funds

S1 State and local governments in Gulf Coast areas devastated by the 2005 hurricanes will no longer be required to pay 10 percent of the cost of repairing their roads, schools and other public works, under a provision of the emergency war spending bill approved by Congress on Thursday night.

S2 Louisiana officials had said that the need to cover some of the repair costs themselves, instead of having the federal government assume all costs, was significantly slowing their recovery efforts.
S3 They praised Congress for making the change, which they estimated would save the state and its affected communities at least $775 million.

S4 Mississippi will also benefit from the change, to a lesser degree.

S5 The Bush administration had earlier opposed lifting the requirement, but after long and intense negotiations with Congress over the much larger provision financing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the president signed the bill yesterday.

S6 ''We are thrilled,'' Gov.
S7 Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana said in a telephone interview.
S8 The exemption, Ms. Blanco said, will particularly help local governments crippled by the storms.

S9 In addition to the direct financial advantage, the waiver will reduce the paperwork that local governments must complete to get federal financing for infrastructure, said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority.
S10 That in itself will save some money, and will also hasten rebuilding.

S11 ''This definitely puts the foot down on the accelerator in terms of speeding up the recovery,'' Mr. Kopplin said.

S12 Under a law enacted by Congress in 1988, the Federal Emergency Management Agency can pay for 90 percent of infrastructure repairs after significant natural disasters.
S13 The requirement that state and local governments match that by paying the other 10 percent was intended to prevent fraud and waste by giving them a financial stake in their own projects.

S14 Louisiana intends to use money freed by the new waiver to help shore up its federally financed program helping homeowners rebuild their houses.
S15 That program, called the Road Home, is facing an eventual shortfall of about $2.9 billion, according to state estimates.
S16 More families have applied than the state anticipated, and have qualified for higher-than-expected grants.

S17 New Orleans has been counting on the waiver to help pay for its own rebuilding plan.
S18 Mayor C. Ray Nagin issued a statement yesterday saying the city was very pleased with the exemption, which he called critical to recovery.

S19 Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, had made a concerted effort to get Congress to waive the 10 percent requirement.
S20 Ms. Landrieu was able to get a waiver included in a previous version of the war spending bill as well, but that measure was vetoed by President Bush because of its troop-withdrawal timetable.

S21 Although the federal government eliminated the payment requirement after past disasters like Sept. 11 and Hurricane Andrew, the administration refused to do so after the 2005 hurricanes, arguing that it had given Louisiana enough federal money to cover the local governments' share of the costs.

S22 But Louisiana officials said that this money came with significant strings attached and that qualifying for it put a huge regulatory burden on overwhelmed local governments, which have applied for federal assistance for about 20,000 projects so far.
S23 States and localities also said they simply did not have the money to put up a 10 percent match.

S24 The waiver is not the only help that the newly enacted law affords the gulf region.
S25 The measure also includes $1.3 billion for repairs to levees along the Mississippi River around New Orleans, and permits the federal government to forgive repayment of disaster loans made to the communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

S26 In addition, it provides for grants for various recovery programs in the region, including one to recruit teachers in Louisiana and another to fight crime by helping New Orleans pay for more police officers and prosecutors.
