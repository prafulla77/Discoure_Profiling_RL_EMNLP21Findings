H A Father’s Grief, a Father's Rage

S1 ONE day this winter, on a pilgrimage that will be either blessedly cathartic or unbearably painful, a retired telecommunications worker and graphic artist named Dom Caruso will make his first visit to two gravesites at St. John's Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens.

S2 Mr. Caruso, a 70-year-old grandfather in fragile health, will begin by bowing his head at the final resting place of his brother Joey, who died in childhood from the ravages of diphtheria.
S3 Then he will stop at the partly submerged burial vault of Dr. Casper Pendola, the young physician who attended to the boy in his final, feverish hours.

S4 At the visit, Mr. Caruso will grapple with how these two departed souls, whose paths crossed by chance, ended up linked forever in a saga of anger and murder.
S5 The case turned the state against an individual, the medical establishment against the immigrant community, and family against family, while plunging Mr. Caruso into torment for most of his adult life.

S6 Eighty years ago next month -- on Feb. 13, 1927 -- Joey Caruso, age 6, died in a tenement apartment in the broad swath of New York then known simply as South Brooklyn.
S7 That same day, 27-year-old Dr. Pendola, who like Joey was of Sicilian heritage, died in the same apartment.

S8 The child succumbed to disease.
S9 The doctor was the victim of cold-blooded murder.
S10 And the man who killed him, first by strangling him, then by slashing his throat so severely that his head was nearly severed from his body, was Francesco Caruso, Joey's father.

S11 Sensational by any standards, the slaying set off a maelstrom of news media frenzy, ethnic hatred, ethical and legal debate, and volatile emotion that would keep New York and much of the rest of the nation in thrall for months.
S12 The case became a cause célèbre, a campaign for justice for Italian immigrants that drew in Fiorello La Guardia, Clarence Darrow and other boldface names of the day.
S13 But however broad the issue became, at its core were a child's death and a father's grief and rage.

S14 A Laugh, or a Twitch?

S15 According to court testimony and other documents, this is how events of that terrible night unfolded.

S16 Francesco Caruso, a beefy, 35-year-old Sicilian immigrant and laborer known as Cheech, lived at 36 Third Street, near Smith Street, with his wife and six children.
S17 On Feb. 11, his son Joey developed a bad sore throat.
S18 The father tried to treat him with over-the-counter remedies.
S19 But the next night, the boy took a turn for the worse.
S20 With no phone in the apartment, the father ran to a local drugstore, owned by one Joseph Pendola, and the pharmacist telephoned his brother, a physician who lived in Maspeth, Queens.

S21 Arriving around 10:45 that night, Dr. Pendola examined Joey, who lay feverish on a cot in the kitchen, and diagnosed his condition as diphtheria, a bacterial disease that ravages the upper respiratory system.

S22 The doctor wrote prescriptions for 10,000 units of antitoxin, to be injected, and a second medication, to be given orally.
S23 The father filled both prescriptions at the Pendola pharmacy, then returned to the apartment, where Dr. Pendola injected the antitoxin.
S24 Leaving the father to administer the oral medication, the doctor departed, promising to return the next morning.

S25 During the night, however, Joey grew sicker and eventually became delirious.
S26 According to testimony his father gave in court, at one point the boy stood up in bed and announced, ''Papa, I am dying.''

S27 By 10 the next morning, the doctor had not returned.
S28 Mr. Caruso raced back to the pharmacy and called for an ambulance.
S29 He returned home to find that his son had gone into convulsions.
S30 The boy died in his arms.

S31 Not until noon did Dr. Pendola reappear at the apartment.
S32 It was the events that followed that led to the bloodletting.

S33 According to Mr. Caruso's testimony in court, upon being informed of the child's death, the doctor simply laughed, although the New York Court of Appeals would later characterize the doctor's reaction as ''some twitching of the facial muscles that might be mistaken for a smile.''

S34 Whatever actually occurred, the enraged father wrapped his powerful hands around Dr. Pendola's throat and began strangling him.
S35 When the doctor fell, Mr. Caruso pulled a butcher knife from a closet and stabbed him twice, fatally, in the throat.
S36 By nightfall, Mr. Caruso was in police custody, charged with first-degree murder.

S37 Newspaper articles describing the crime were predictably sensational.
S38 ''Physician Is Slain by Crazed Father as Boy Patient Dies,'' blared the headline in The New York Times.
S39 ''Crazed Father Flees Bier; Confesses After Capture,'' shouted The Daily News.

S40 Taking note of Mr. Caruso's Sicilian heritage and lack of formal education, the articles variously described the defendant as ''dull-eyed and expressionless,'' an ''ignorant father'' given to speaking ''broken English,'' and ''a raging giant whose black eyes were afire with hate and revenge.''

S41 Deliberations, and Death Row

S42 The trial, before Judge Alonzo McLaughlin in Kings County Court, then at Joralemon Street and Boerum Place in Downtown Brooklyn, had moments of high drama.

S43 Jury selection, which began April 4, proved to be a complicated affair and took two days.
S44 When a brief postponement was granted, the doctor's distraught widow, Helen, stood up in the gallery and shouted: ''This man murdered my husband, and it was a cruel, cold murder!
S45 He should be killed.
S46 Instead, he gets an adjournment.''

S47 Once the testimony got under way, the defendant's own words were chilling.
S48 ''I said he had killed my boy and I was going to kill him,'' Mr. Caruso said of the doctor.
S49 ''Soon he didn't breathe anymore, and I ran to the kitchen, got a carving knife and stabbed him in the throat.
S50 My wife stood in the doorway and saw it all.''

S51 Ultimately, the jury rejected the defense's argument that Mr. Caruso was suffering from temporary insanity and concluded that his actions had been deliberate and premeditated.
S52 On April 7, Mr. Caruso was convicted of first-degree murder, which carried an automatic death sentence.
S53 As the judge congratulated the Caruso jurors, noting that ''any other finding would have been a miscarriage of justice,'' the defendant was packed off to death row at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining.

S54 Star-Studded Counsel

S55 Then the tide turned.

S56 A campaign to spare Mr. Caruso's life picked up momentum among Italian-American friendship societies.
S57 An ambitious New York congressman named Fiorello La Guardia visited the Caruso family.
S58 A defense committee was organized by a press agent named Alexander Marky, and thanks to him, Mr. Caruso's wife and daughter were able to make appeals for mercy over the radio.

S59 The defense committee recruited renowned lawyers to its cause, including Walter Pollak, who would later help defend the young African-Americans sentenced to death in the notorious Scottsboro Boys case.
S60 The committee's most prominent member was Clarence Darrow, the legendary defender of evolution in the Scopes ''monkey trial,'' who came out of retirement to help draft Mr. Caruso's appeal.

S61 On Nov. 22, alleging 14 trial errors and citing more than 100 other cases, this star-studded legal team persuaded the Court of Appeals to void Mr. Caruso's conviction for first-degree murder and order a new trial.
S62 The court's chief judge was Benjamin Cardozo, who would go on to join the United States Supreme Court.

S63 At the Caruso home, the defendant's family celebrated the good news with a fat Thanksgiving turkey.
S64 At the Pendola home, the doctor's widow rocked her baby daughter, Catherine, and wept.
S65 ''We have nothing to be thankful for,'' she told reporters.
S66 ''My baby and I are alone.
S67 And the man who killed my husband, my baby's father, is alive and may go free.''

S68 Mr. Caruso's new trial began two months later, and this time around, matters took some curious turns.
S69 A jury was impaneled in a brisk two hours; the very next day, Jan. 31, 1928, Judge McLaughlin, who had presided at the first trial and sentenced Mr. Caruso to death a scant nine months earlier, halted the proceedings to allow Mr. Caruso to plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter.

S70 The prosecutor, on record as saying Mr. Caruso should face the first-degree murder charge again in the second trial, also did a turnabout, agreeing to the manslaughter plea.
S71 The judge then sentenced the defendant to serve a maximum of 20 years.

S72 In the end, Mr. Caruso served only six years.
S73 Returning to his family, he fathered another son, Dom, and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity, working as a laborer, a house painter and a caretaker.
S74 He died in 1968, at age 77.

S75 After the Anguish

S76 For decades, Dom Caruso had a troubled relationship with his father, who, in the son's eyes, despised him because he could never replace his beloved brother.
S77 As Dom remembered it, his mother once told him that his father had tried to have the midwife write the name ''Joey'' on his birth certificate when he was born, but the mother had vehemently rejected the idea.

S78 One morning in 1952, when Dom was 16, his father sat him down at the breakfast table of their Jericho, Long Island, home and, already drunk on red wine, as was his custom, began to tell an extraordinary story.

S79 According to Dom, his father said that Dr. Pendola was not the first man he had murdered.
S80 The father, a strapping man of 230 pounds, said that he was a longtime ''made man'' in the Sicilian Mafia, and that, through beatings, knifings and shootings, he had served as an enforcer for Salvatore D'Aquila, an Al Capone associate and the capo di tutti capi of the New York Mafia.

S81 So, Dom Caruso recounted, when Cheech Caruso found himself facing the electric chair, he was not abandoned.
S82 Al Capone and Salvatore D'Aquila helped to set up a defense fund, hire top-flight lawyers to work on Mr. Caruso's appeal, and orchestrate the abrupt denouement of the second murder trial by pressuring Gov.
S83 Alfred E. Smith or one of his top lieutenants.
S84 The governor, who would run for president that year, enjoyed huge support from Italian-Americans.

S85 The father's tale is almost impossible to substantiate.
S86 On the one hand, Dom Caruso has no physical evidence of the father's statements about the Mafia and the trial.
S87 Moreover, Dom's own family has been at least partly skeptical of the tale; for example, his siblings hotly disputed Dom's claim, based on his talk with his father, that their brother Sal had been named after Salvatore D'Aquila.

S88 As for the involvement of Smith's administration, the best evidence is very unspecific.
S89 Thomas Reppetto, author of ''American Mafia: A History of Its Rise to Power,'' said that the governor was undeniably under the sway of powerful party bosses, particularly those in Tammany Hall, who would not have hesitated to seek a favor from the Mafia.
S90 But, Mr. Reppetto also said, he knew of no proof that Al Smith had ever done favors for the Mafia.

S91 On the other hand, there are some facts that lend weight to the father's story.
S92 On the day after Mr. Caruso's arraignment, for instance, The New York Times noted that in 1918 Francesco Caruso had been arrested by the police and fined $100 for carrying a concealed pistol, not a fix encountered by a regular laborer.
S93 Then there are the turnabouts of the judge and prosecutor at the second trial, and the question of how the costly appeals effort on Mr. Caruso's behalf was financed, even if it was a cause célèbre.

S94 Whatever the truth may be, it is difficult to know exactly what relatives of the victim may have felt about this claim or about the case in general.
S95 Attempts to reach direct descendants of Dr. Pendola -- through death, Social Security and newspaper records and through St. John's Cemetery -- were unsuccessful.
S96 Among relatives who could be located and did agree to speak was Michael Criss, whose great-grandfather Pietro Pendola was Dr. Pendola's cousin.
S97 Mr. Criss, who teaches at Oklahoma State University and is the unofficial historian of the Pendola family in the United States, said he had first heard about the murder from cousins who were small children when it occurred.

S98 ''I think what Caruso did was heinous,'' Mr. Criss said, ''even if you take into consideration his emotional state.
S99 However, I see no reason to blame his family and descendants for his actions.''

S100 When one of those descendants, Dom Caruso, visits St. John's Cemetery, the first member of his family ever to do so, he will find two graves about a 10-minute walk from each other.
S101 They are remarkable for their unremarkableness.

S102 Joey's final resting place is an unmarked charity grave, which was paid for by the Roman Catholic Church's Society of St. Vincent de Paul.

S103 Dr. Pendola is buried in a marble family vault shaded by pine trees.
S104 There is the surname Pendola, but there is no visible monument bearing birth or death dates, and no first name.
S105 There are no words of solace or affection, no religious symbols or biblical inscriptions, no mention of the fact that the deceased was a husband, a father and a practitioner of the healing arts.

S106 For Dom Caruso, whose profound sadness over what happened that wintry night in 1927 extends to the Pendola family as well as his own, the primary concern remains how the outcome of the case must have affected the doctor's widow and daughter, even though he was never able to ascertain their fate.

S107 ''I doubt that poor Helen found any peace in her lifetime,'' Mr. Caruso said of the doctor's widow, who, according to Mr. Criss, died three decades ago.
S108 ''I hope and pray that Catherine did.
S109 I'd like to believe that.''
