S3 RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazil detained over 2,600 adults and around 340 minors in operations carried out against homicide and social violence in various states, said the police on Saturday.

S4 During the two-day "Cronos" operation, nearly 450 people were detained because of homicide and femicide, 1,252 for various crimes and 640 for drug trafficking or illegal possession of firearms.

S5 State-run media Agencia Brasil reported that about 7,800 police officers, coordinated by the Ministry of Public Security, took part in the operation, which also found 383 kg of drugs, including marijuana and cocaine.

S6 "The most important is the protection and guarantee of life, especially combating femicide.
S7 This cowardly crime is unacceptable," Public Security Minister Raul Jungmann said.

S8 According to data released by the Brazilian Public Security Yearbook 2018 earlier this month, the South American country has broken its own record for the number of murders in 2017, with homicide cases rising around 3 percent from 2016 to 63,880.
