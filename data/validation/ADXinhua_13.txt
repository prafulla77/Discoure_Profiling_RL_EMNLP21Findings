H South Sudan's weather agency warns of devastating flood risk - Xinhua

S1 JUBA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South Sudan's Meteorological Department has warned that several regions in the East African country are at risk of floods caused by torrential rains.

S2 The weather agency told reporters on Thursday that heavy rainfall is expected in the months of June, July and August (JJA) and may cause devastating floods in the flood-prone areas of Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Unity.

S3 Samuel Thon, a Forecaster at the Meteorological Department, said the towns of Bor, Bentiu, Aweil, and Pibor are particularly at high risk of floods.

S4 "JJA (June, July and August) 2018 rainfall forecast indicates increased likelihood for flooding in the flood prone areas for example Bor, Bentiu, Aweil, Pibor and Upper Nile States plus other flood prone areas.
S5 So we are expecting floods because the rainfall is much," Thon said.

S6 According to South Sudan's Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Risk Management, several regions in the country are prone to recurrent floods every year in the rainy season, between May and October, which threatens the lives and livelihoods of thousands of people.

S7 Last year, torrential rains forced over 100,000 people from their homes and destroyed valuable property in central and northern South Sudan.
