S3 JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces said Tuesday a Hamas teen operative from the Gaza Strip has been arrested in Israel and divulged a much-coveted information about cross-border "terror tunnels."

S4 The 17-year-old Palestinian from Jabalia city in northern Gaza is an activist with Hamas' military wing of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the Shin Bet security agency said in a statement.
S5 He was arrested near the border on Friday after infiltrating into Israel's territory, the Shin Bet said.

S6 On Tuesday, he was indicted at the Be'er Sheva District Court in southern Israel.

S7 A military spokesperson said in a separate statement that during his investigation, the defendant "conveyed detailed information regarding continued efforts to further develop the Hamas tunnel network."

S8 According to the Shin Bet, he enrolled in "Hamas' northern Gaza division" shortly after Israel's 51-day offensive in Gaza in July and August of 2014, which claimed the lives of at least 2,251 Palestinians.

S9 He went into a training program, much of it "bore offensive characteristics, including penetrating (Israel,) breaking into buildings, and exploding bombs," according to the Shin Bet.

S12 According to his indictment, he took part in digging "combat tunnels" that were designed to be used by Hamas to kidnap Israeli soldiers, perpetrate suicide attacks, and attacking Israeli communities near the border.

S13 The announcement came after last week Israel said it has uncovered a Hamas "terror tunnel" stretching from Gaza to Israel.

S14 Increased military activity by soldiers and bulldozers near the border to uncover the tunnel triggered four days of fire exchanges.
S15 A Palestinian woman was killed in her home by the strikes while no injuries were reported on the Israeli side.
