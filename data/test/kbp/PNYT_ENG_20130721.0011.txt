H  'Machete' takes swing at state 

S1  A lawsuit filed by Austin filmmaker Robert Rodriguez and the production company behind his film ''Machete’' accuses The Texas Film Commission of denying agreed-to financial incentives after the agency decided the film was ''inappropriate.''

S2  Machete Chop Shop Inc. says in a suit filed Saturday in Travis County that the commission backed out of partially reimbursing the cost of the film after coming under fire for its violence and depiction of Texans.

S3  Before the movie was released in September 2010, anti-immigration groups were upset over the film’s trailer, citing its violent imagery and Robert DeNiro’s cartoonish role as a senator who kills illegal immigrants.

S4  According to court documents, the producers’ application for a grant under the Texas Moving Image Industry Incentive Program was approved in May 2009, one month after Gov.
S5 Rick Perry signed the program into law at Rodriguez’s Troublemaker Studios.

S6  At the bill signing, Rod-riguez announced that the bill would allow him to make films in Texas, including ''Machete.''

S7  The complaint states that former commission head Bob Hudgins verified that the script complied with content requirements and also claims he approved the incentive package.

S8  Once filmmakers knew they had additional state funding, they increased their budget, the complaint says, banking on a state contribution of nearly $8 million.
