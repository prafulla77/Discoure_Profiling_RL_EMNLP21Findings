H Getting Inventive To Prevent Flooding

S1 To the Editor:

S2 I read, with interest, your article ''Mamaroneck Grasps for Way to Avoid a Repeat'' (April 22), about the flooding problems.
S3 Reminds me of Greenburgh!

S4 A few years ago residents of Babbitt Court in the town of Greenburgh expressed frustration at the studies and meetings held to address the problem of flooding on their street.
S5 Working with the town and federal governments, they secured a grant to uplift some of the homes on their street -- putting the homes on stilts.
S6 The homes don't get flooded anymore.
S7 There is less property damage, and less stress on residents.

S8 I hope one day the Army Corps of Engineers will solve the flooding problem near the river.
S9 Until that time comes, we've come up with a less expensive and ambitious plan that has helped some families.

S10 I urge Mamaroneck officials not to hold their breath.

S11 PAUL FEINER  Town Supervisor, Greenburgh
