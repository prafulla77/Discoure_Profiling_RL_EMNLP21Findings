S6 GAZA, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinians were killed and more than 30 wounded on Tuesday evening by Israeli troops' gunfire in northern Gaza Strip, close to the border with Israel, medics said.

S7 Ashraf al-Qedra, spokesman of the health ministry in Gaza, told reporters that one of the two killed is Mohamed Abu Naji, 34 years old, and the other's identity is still unknown.

S8 Al-Qedra said that over 30 Palestinians were injured, including a paramedic and two local photo journalists, adding that they were injured by Israeli soldiers' gunfire in northern Gaza Strip.

S9 The demonstration at Erez crossing on the border was organized by the high commission of the "Great March of Return" to defy the Israeli blockade.

S10 Hundreds of Palestinian demonstrators joined the protest on Tuesday, which was called "together for protecting the rights of refugees and breaking the Israeli siege."

S11 Since March 30, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been going through popular protests against Israel.
S12 Demonstrators protest close to the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip, which has been ruled by Hamas movement since 2007.

S13 On Monday night, two Palestinian young men were killed and another was injured after a missile fired by an Israeli drone directly hit them when they approached the fence of the border.

S14 Al-Qedra said that since March 30, around 180 Palestinians were killed and over 19,000 injured, more than half of whom were shot by Israeli soldiers' gunfire, including women, children, paramedics and journalists.

S15 Israel accused Islamic Hamas movement of standing behind organizing the protests and rallies to pressure Israel to end around 12 years of a tight blockade imposed on Gaza.

S16 Efforts exerted by Egypt and the United Nations Special envoy Nickolay Mladenov had so far failed to broker a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas-led groups in the Gaza Strip.
