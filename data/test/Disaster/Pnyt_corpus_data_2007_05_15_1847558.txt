H Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains

S1 Miles and miles of bigger and stronger levees have been built along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers since the deadly floods of 1993, and millions of dollars have been spent on drainage improvements.

S2 Yet as the rush of water that caused the Missouri River to overflow its banks and submerge dozens of towns last week rolled toward St. Louis on Monday, attention was turned to a metropolitan region that since 1993 has seen runaway residential and commercial development in the rivers' flood paths.

S3 About 28,000 homes have been built and more than 6,000 acres of commercial and industrial space developed on land that was underwater in 1993, according to research by Nicholas Pinter, a geologist who studies the region at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.

S4 Building is happening on flood plains across Missouri, but most of the development is in the St. Louis area, and it is estimated to be worth more than $2.2 billion.
S5 Though scientists warn about the danger of such building, the Missouri government has subsidized some of it through tax financing for builders.

S6 ''No one has really looked at the cumulative effect,'' said Timothy M. Kusky, a professor of natural sciences at St. Louis University, who calculates that there has been more development on the Missouri River flood plain in the years since 1993 than at any other time in the history of the region.

S7 The good news for St. Louis right now is that forecasters say the two rivers will crest well below their 1993 levels by Tuesday, sparing the area significant flooding.
S8 But many scientists remain concerned that the effect of the new construction, should a levee break, could eventually be even more severe flooding.

S9 Levees constrict a river's path and raise its water level, which causes higher, faster flow.
S10 A flood plain, conversely, exists in nature to absorb a river's overflow.

S11 ''The more levees we build, the higher we have to build them,'' Professor Kusky said.
S12 ''It's a self-perpetuating problem.''

S13 Still, people have been drawn to the area, assured by the sense of security the levees provide.
S14 Disincentives beyond the possibility of flooding seem to be few.

S15 ''This was absolutely a dodged bullet,'' Professor Pinter said.
S16 ''This could have been a very bad situation for St. Louis, but luckily it was a near-miss.''

S17 People living in the flood plains are eligible for the National Flood Insurance Program or for any private insurance they can secure, though the private alternatives are increasingly difficult to obtain.
S18 And they are entitled to whatever federal disaster relief is offered to the state after a flood, be it temporary housing or buyouts, said Butch Kinerney, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

S19 THF Realty Inc. used Missouri's tax program, known as tax increment financing, to build what is said to be the largest strip mall in the country on land in the Chesterfield Valley area of St. Louis County that was submerged in the floods of 1993.
S20 The shopping center, which cost $275 million to build, opened in 1999 and now has more than two million square feet of retail space, mall officials said.

S21 The developers spent more than $35 million on levee and storm drainage improvements, replacing an old levee that had offered protection against a 100-year flood with a levee that met the standards for a 500-year flood.
S22 And, they said, they have brought jobs and revenue to a formerly sleepy part of the county.

S23 ''We built the shopping center and interchange that opened the entire valley,'' said Marian Nunn, the chief operating officer of THF Realty.
S24 ''The difference is that the levee is maintained now, on top of being bigger, stronger and better.
S25 The risks are really substantially mitigated.''

S26 The company was able to use the special financing because Missouri allows it for projects in areas that are considered blighted, or where development is not likely to occur without help.

S27 ''We will continue to build even more,'' Ms. Nunn said.

S28 Faith in the levees seems to trump other concerns here.

S29 ''We're not even close to having any issues,'' said Brian McGownd, the deputy director of public works in Chesterfield.
S30 Of the new levee, Mr. McGownd said, ''We have 100 percent confidence that it's done right, and the way it's supposed to be, and that it will be a good, strong levee for many years.''

S31 Fear of flooding did not appear to scare off prospective buyers at the New Town at St. Charles, a housing development whose sales office hummed with activity on Sunday, even as the Missouri River was rising.
S32 Although the community is near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, residents are not required to have flood insurance, because they are beyond the 100-year flood plain.

S33 The location was a selling point for Ken Snider, a high school teacher from St. Louis.

S34 ''It's not going to flood here for another 100 years,'' Mr. Snider said, ''and I won't be around by then.''

S35 But critics of the developments say someone else is likely to be around then, and taxpayers in general will carry the tab after the next disaster bailout.

S36 ''If history tells us anything, it's that levees once built eventually fail,'' Professor Pinter said.
S37 ''But instead of being farmland there, now it's a strip mall or residential area, or a whole city.''

S38 The floods of 1993 killed 38 people and caused $16 billion in damage across the Midwest.
S39 More than 500 counties were declared federal disaster areas.

S40 Adolphus A. Busch IV, a member of the Anheuser-Busch brewing family who helped found the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance in St. Louis in 2000, is alarmed at the pace of development in the rivers' paths after the 1993 flood.

S41 ''That was the milestone for us,'' Mr. Busch said.
S42 ''At that point the federal government came in and did major buyouts, and people said, 'Look, we've learned our lesson: no more development.'
S43 Well, that lasted for about six or seven years.''

S44 He continued, ''We always realized that there would be fringe development, but we never envisioned after 1993 that anyone would try to build major levees and enclose thousands of acres.''

S45 Some people already living in the flood plain at the time of the last big flood now say that it just makes economic sense for them to stay close to the river, and that it is an issue of personal-risk calculation and property rights.

S46 Doris Hulst, a 65-year-old school bus driver, is the sole homeowner on a 109-acre swath of land that once housed three trailer parks near the Missouri River in St. Charles County.

S47 ''They all took the buyout,'' Mrs. Hulst said of her neighbors who relocated after the flood.
S48 ''I took the buyout on a trailer I owned across the street, but you didn't make enough money to buy anything decent.''

S49 Today, Mrs. Hulst's trailer is elevated on three rows of cinder blocks.
S50 ''We'll be fine as long as the Mississippi doesn't back up,'' she said.

S51 Alan Dooley, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District, said people, like water, had certain natural inclinations.

S52 ''People have a tendency to locate near water,'' Mr. Dooley said.
S53 ''These people vote; they pay taxes.
S54 It's kind of difficult to go through with a broad brush and say, 'You all ought to get out of here.'
