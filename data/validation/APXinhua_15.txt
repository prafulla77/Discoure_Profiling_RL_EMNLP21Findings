H Politicians call for removal of Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star - Xinhua

S1 LOS ANGELES, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- Politicians voted Monday night to urge for the removal of President Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, West Hollywood mayor said.

S2 West Hollywood Mayor John Duran and Councilwoman Lindsey Horvath offered a resolution Monday night urging the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the president's star "due to his disturbing treatment of women and other actions that do not meet the shared values of the City of West Hollywood, the region, state, and country."

S3 The City Council voted unanimously, and passed the resolution.
S4 The decision will ultimately be up to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.

S5 "West Hollywood City council unanimously passes resolution asking the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the Donald Trump star on Hollywood Walk of Fame," the Mayor posted on Twitter.

S6 The council's staff report on the resolution also cited the Trump administration's separation of immigrant families at the U.S. border and Trump's "denial of findings from the United States intelligence community regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election and continued refusal to hold Russia accountable for its crimes."

S7 The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has never removed a marker from the Walk of Fame and turned down a 2015 request to remove comedian Bill Cosby's star.

S8 Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized repeatedly in recent years.
S9 In regard to the most recent vandalism, a man accused of smashing Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a pickaxe was charged Monday with felony vandalism, according to the City News Service, a local news outlet.

S10 Following the vandalism, the CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which administers the Walk of Fame, urged would-be vandals to vote if they wanted to make a political statement.

S11 Trump earned his star back in 2007.
S12 Trump's star is currently boarded over.
