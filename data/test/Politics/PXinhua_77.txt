S3 TOKYO, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court in Japan on Wednesday rejected demands from the Okinawa prefectural government to halt the relocation of a controversial U.S. base within Japan's southernmost prefecture despite calls from local officials and residents for the base to be moved off the island.

S4 The Okinawa prefectural government's appeal for the suspension of work for the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from the crowded residential area of Ginowan to the less populated Henoko coastal district in Nago, both in Okinawa, was dismissed by a lower court with the ruling upheld by the high court on Wednesday.

S5 The central government now plans to restart landfill work in earnest on Dec. 14 for the construction of the new U.S. replacement military facility, despite the local government highlighting the fact that documents necessary for temporarily storing soil and sand near the construction site had not been submitted.

S6 Okinawa hosts the bulk of U.S. military facilities in Japan, yet the tiny sub-tropical island accounts for just a small fraction of Japan's total landmass.

S7 As well as shouldering the majority of U.S. bases and being victims of U.S. base-linked workers' criminal activities, which span rape and murder, to driving under the influence of alcohol, as well as a steady flow of accidents and mishaps involving U.S. military aircraft, the new location for the base has an extremely delicate ecosystem unique to Okinawa that the locals desperately want to protect.

S8 The overall plans for the new base involve 157 hectares of land being reclaimed from pristine waters off the Henoko area and the building of a V-shaped runway.

S9 The plans stem from a pact made between the United States and Japan in 1996, with Henoko being selected as the replacement site in 1999.

S10 The local and central governments have been at odds over the relocation of the base since 1999, with Denny Tamaki, who became Okinawa governor in October following the death of his predecessor Governor Takeshi Onaga, urging the central government to reduce Okinawa's disproportionate base-hosting burdens and shift the new base off the island.
