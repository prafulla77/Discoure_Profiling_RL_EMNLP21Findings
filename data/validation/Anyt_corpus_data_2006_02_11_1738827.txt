H Ex-FEMA Leader Faults Response by White House

S1 Michael D. Brown, the former federal emergency management chief who became a ridiculed symbol of the Bush administration's flawed response to Hurricane Katrina, returned in anger to Capitol Hill on Friday and lashed back at his former superiors.

S2 Mr. Brown said that he told a senior White House official early on of the New Orleans flooding, and that the administration was too focused on terrorism to respond properly to natural disasters.

S3 Testifying before a Senate committee, Mr. Brown said he notified a senior White House official -- who he said was probably Joe Hagin, the deputy White House chief of staff, but might have been Andrew H. Card Jr., the chief of staff -- on the day the hurricane hit to report that it had turned into his ''worst nightmare'' and that New Orleans was flooding.

S4 It was the first public identification of any White House official who was said to have directly received reports of extensive flooding on Monday, Aug. 29, the day Hurricane Katrina hit.

S5 In the aftermath of the storm, administration officials said they were caught by surprise when they were told of the levee breach on Tuesday, Aug. 30.
S6 Mr. Hagin was the senior staff member with President Bush on the day the hurricane hit, when Mr. Bush was traveling in California.

S7 Mr. Brown's politically charged appearance before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs quickly divided the panel's members by party.

S8 Several Republican senators peppered him with hostile questions and suggested he was trying to deflect the blame from his own failures.

S9 In contrast, Mr. Brown drew a gentle, even warm response from Democrats who said he had unfairly been made a scapegoat by the administration, though last year it was frequently Mr. Brown himself who drew the most fire from Democrats in Washington.

S10 In contrast to low-key statements in the past, Mr. Brown, who resigned under pressure on Sept. 12 as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was aggressively on the defensive, saying he was ''sick and tired'' of his remarks or e-mail messages being taken out of context or hearing that he lacked the leadership skills for his job.

S11 Mr. Brown said it was ''baloney'' for Department of Homeland Security officials to claim they did not know of the extent of the flooding until Tuesday, because he and other FEMA officials had notified them the day before.

S12 In response to questioning, Mr. Brown also said he believed he told the White House on Monday that a breach had occurred in the 17th Street Canal levee, passing on observations made by one of his staff members on the ground in New Orleans that day.

S13 ''Everything that we had planned about, worried about, that FEMA, frankly, had worried about for 10 years was coming true,'' Mr. Brown said he told the White House aide.

S14 Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said Friday morning while the hearing was under way that the administration already knew the city was being flooded.
S15 Regardless of the call from Mr. Brown, there were conflicting reports about whether a levee had been breached, Mr. McClellan said.

S16 ''The top priority at that time was on saving lives; it was on search and rescue operations,'' Mr. McClellan said.

S17 Mr. Brown said that he could not recall if he personally called the homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, to relay the account of the levee breach.
S18 Even if he had, Mr. Brown said, it would have been a waste of time because FEMA's role within the Homeland Security Department had been subordinated to fighting terror.
S19 As a result of that, he said, he was unable to quickly get the kind of action he needed, unless he called the White House staff.

S20 The Bush administration, as a whole, he said, did not seem to care enough about natural disasters and had relegated natural disasters to a ''stepchild'' of national security.

S21 ''It is my belief,'' Mr. Brown told the senators, that if ''we've confirmed that a terrorist has blown up the 17th Street Canal levee, then everybody would have jumped all over that and been trying to do everything they could.''

S22 Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman, said Mr. Brown's disdain for the new domestic security structure left the department without crucial information it needed about what was happening in New Orleans.
S23 Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, said Mr. Brown was shifting attention away from his own lack of responsiveness to the disaster.

S24 ''You're not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies and say, 'You know something, I made some big mistakes.
S25 I wasn't focused.
S26 I didn't get things done,' '' Mr. Coleman said.

S27 The remark provoked Mr. Brown to raise his voice almost to a shout.

S28 ''What do you want me to say?''
S29 Mr. Brown said.
S30 ''I have admitted to mistakes publicly.
S31 I've admitted to mistakes in hearings.
S32 What more, Senator Coleman, do you want from me?''

S33 Mr. Coleman responded: ''A little more candor would suffice.''

S34 Democrats, including Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii, said Mr. Brown was being made a scapegoat to deflect criticism from the White House.

S35 ''Keep your chin up and fight back,'' Mr. Lautenberg said.

S36 Several senators, including Democrats, said they were surprised by Mr. Brown's inability to remember crucial details from the early days of the storm, including which White House aide he spoke with and whether Mr. Bush participated in the telephone call.

S37 Mr. Brown also gave differing answers about whether he actually mentioned the levee breach to the White House.
S38 At first he said he could not recall whether he used those words but then later he said that he was sure Mr. Hagin or Mr. Card knew it and that he would have told one of them about the breach during the conversation.

S39 He said he could not recall whether he told the White House aide that he needed any particular help -- at a time when the city was flooding, thousands were packed into the Superdome without adequate supplies and others were beginning to climb to roofs or attics to avoid drowning.

S40 Two senior Homeland Security Department officials, who testified after Mr. Brown, said that his unwillingness to honor the chain of command and give regular updates to Mr. Chertoff or others in the department severely hampered the department's response.

S41 ''We have a president, we have a secretary that are seeing things on television, we're getting reports, what is going on down there?''
S42 said Gen. Matthew E. Broderick, who served as the director of the Homeland Security Department's information center in Washington during the storm, recalling his request to FEMA for more information.
