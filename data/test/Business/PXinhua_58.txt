S4 VIENTIANE, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- "Every project department of China Railway is ready to be dispatched at any time!"

S5 At the end of this July, when a deadly flash flood swept through Attapeu province of southern Laos, China Railway, a Chinese company constructing the China-Laos Railway in the country, provided assistance to the disaster-stricken areas without any hesitation.

S6 Meanwhile, Lao Asia Pacific Satellite Co., Ltd. (LAOSAT), a joint venture between China and Laos, immediately sent a technical team to provide live satellite television broadcast and emergency communication service for the victims and rescuers in the disaster-stricken Attapeu, and transmit real-time video content through the satellite network at the forefront of the disaster area.

S7 These cases are not rare in Laos nowadays.
S8 Chinese enterprises have been playing an increasingly important role in enhancing people's livelihood with practical actions.

S9 Nam Ou River is the largest eastern tributary of the Mekong River in Laos.
S10 It is one of the key hydropower resource bases that the Lao government is pushing forward to explore.
S11 PowerChina is developing a full basin cascade hydropower project at that site.

S12 As of August this year, the first phase of the project has been put into operation and has delivered more than 3 billion KWh of electricity to the northern part of Laos.
S13 The second phase of the project is expected to be completed by 2020 and will guarantee 12 percent of the electricity supply in Laos.

S14 "Based on the actual needs of Laos, integrating with Laos' social and economic development and people's livelihood planning, we creatively propose a scientific development plan of seven-dam cascade project, which is fully recognized by the Lao government," said Huang Yande, assisting general manager of PowerChina Resources Limited and general manager of the branch company in Laos.

S15 Bounpong Ketsadasak used to work with Laos' state-owned Electricite Du Laos (EDL) and now works as a deputy general manager in charge of PowerChina's Nam Ou phase one project.

S16 Ketsadasak said that the Laos' strategy of "Battery of Southeast Asia" goes well with the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, and Nam Ou cascade hydropower project was a great achievement of the Belt and Road Initiative.

S17 "The Belt and Road is a great cause.
S18 As a witness and participant, I will be devoted to it with my Chinese colleagues," said the Lao manager.

S19 Bounthong Chitmany, deputy prime minister of the Lao government, spoke highly of the construction and operation of the Nam Ou cascade hydropower project and its contribution to local economic and social development.

S20 Back in the 1990s, Sinohydro Bureau 10 Co., LTD undertook the construction of Nam Leuk Hydropower Plant, which was widely praised by the local government and society.

S21 The successful construction of the Nam Leuk has consolidated a market position for Sinohydro Bureau 10 Co., LTD in Lao hydropower industry.

S22 Yu Mingchuan, deputy general manager of Sinohydro Bureau 10 and general manager of its Lao branch, told Xinhua that thanks to scientific management and hard work, the company has been recognized as an international and professional construction team with a good reputation in Laos.

S23 The company is well-known in Laos for its capabilities of constructing large and medium-sized hydropower projects and installing electro-mechanical equipment.

S24 "Under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, our company will strive for the economic and social development of China and Laos, and contribute to the bilateral friendship," Yu said.
