S6 BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- China and Brunei on Monday agreed to upgrade their relations to a strategic cooperative partnership.

S7 The two countries also pledged to be good partners featuring mutual trust in politics, mutual benefit in economy, mutual understanding in people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and mutual assistance in multilateral affairs.

S8 The consensus was reached during talks between visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brunei's Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah.

S16 China appreciates Brunei's firm adherence to the one-China policy and will continue to support Brunei in pursuing a development path that suits its own national conditions, Xi said.

S17 China sees Brunei as an important partner for cooperation in building the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and is willing to align the Belt and Road Initiative with Brunei's Wawasan 2035, a strategy for economic diversification, in a bid to boost the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries, he said.

S24 Both sides should continue to advance maritime cooperation and the negotiations on the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, thus building the sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation, he added.

S25 For his part, Hassanal extended warm welcome to Xi for his first state visit to Brunei, saying that the visit will deepen the traditional friendly relations between the two countries and strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.
