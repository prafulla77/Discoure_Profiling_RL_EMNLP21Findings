H Floodwaters Reveal a Divide Between Upstate and Down

S1 EVEN before last April's disastrous floods, the Meyers Grove neighborhood along the Neversink River wasn't exactly Malibu, just an unpretentious jumble of modest houses, trailers and bungalows, many of them converted from summer vacation cottages.

S2 But 10 months after the river roared over its banks, cresting at 11 feet over flood stage, it still looks like parts of New Orleans, with some houses repaired and rebuilt, some vacant and condemned, and others reduced to doleful piles of rubble, waiting to be hauled away.

S3 Last year's flooding on the Delaware River and some of its tributaries, including the Neversink, may be a fleeting memory downstate, but for residents in Meyers Grove, along Rivers Edge Road down the road in nearby Huguenot and in dozens of other riverside towns and hamlets, it's no more past than Katrina is for residents of the Gulf Coast.

S4 So, if Mark D. House, the supervisor of the Town of Deerpark in Orange County, whose 9,000 residents include the people of Meyers Grove, sounds a little hyperbolic as he talks about reservoir levels and spillway management, it's not just him.
S5 This is one subject where the upstate/downstate divide is now more divided than ever.

S6 ''It's like they're holding a gun to my head, it's loaded, they have their finger on the trigger, and they're squeezing the trigger,'' he said, navigating his way around the neighborhood in his PT Cruiser.
S7 ''And they have the gall to say, oh, by the way, if this should go off, it's not our fault and it's not our responsibility.''

S8 The gun, if you want to call it that, is the water in the Neversink Reservoir, now over 100 percent of capacity at a time that it's usually around 80.
S9 When kept at a lower level, the reservoir, which is part of New York City's water supply system, can help prevent or limit flooding, by giving water from swollen rivers a place to collect rather than cascading downstream.
S10 But keeping such reservoirs as full as possible maximizes the city's ability to provide water downstate even in an extended dry spell.

S11 The city's Department of Environmental Protection has always said that it's in the water delivery business, not the flood control business, and that, in fact, its reservoirs in the Catskill and Delaware systems have limited abilities to release water and manage flooding.

S12 But after two severe floods almost back to back, first in September 2004, then in April 2005, that policy now comes across as imperial arrogance to flooded residents and communities.
S13 So up and down the rivers, people are hiring lawyers, forming organizations, gearing up for something other than business as it's usually been conducted.

S14 In a letter to New York's two United States senators and local representatives, State Senator John J. Bonacic, whose district encompasses much of the city's watershed, said last week it was outrageous that a year after the flooding, reservoir levels were still at 100 percent capacity, in advance of expected spring rains and snowmelt.
S15 He is calling on officials to lobby against a federal designation the city needs to avoid building a $10 billion filtration system unless the city satisfactorily addresses dam safety and flood control issues.

S16 ''The D.E.P.
S17 's position is arrogant,'' he wrote.
S18 ''It is the most arrogant position by any agency that I have seen in all my years of holding public office.''

S19 FOR its part, the environmental agency says it has already altered its policies, consistent with its legal obligations, particularly with the Delaware River Basin Commission, where New York State and its neighbors New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware must approve changes in water releases.
S20 The agency says it has already begun a program of releases of water based on anticipated snowmelt and has proposed a more ambitious one that would allow releases that would be equal to the water from a one-inch rainfall over a six-hour period.

S21 ''I think it's a start, and it's a show of good faith,'' said Michael Principe, deputy commissioner of the D.E.P.
S22 ''We can never reduce 100 percent of the risk, but this is a way of mitigating some of the risk, which is the best we can expect.''

S23 In truth, there's a lot more at issue than the D.E.P.
S24 's flood control measures on reservoirs and dams built with limited flood control technology.
S25 Rivers do flood.
S26 Blame nature.
S27 People do live in flood-prone areas.
S28 Meyers Grove is one of them.

S29 Still, it's clear that the recent flooding has, for now at least, changed the balance between the people upstate who live beneath the dams and people downstate who just want to know that water will come out when they open the tap.
S30 Like it or not, the city has a toe in the flood control business, after all.

S31 For now, the reservoirs are full.
S32 The rainy season is around the corner.
S33 So people watch the weather, they watch the rivers, they wait, and they worry.
